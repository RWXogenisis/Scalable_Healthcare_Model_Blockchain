# Blockchain Scalability Analysis With Encryption

## Introduction

In this project, we conduct a detailed scalability analysis of a blockchain-based communication system designed for secure data exchange between two hospitals. Each hospital maintains its own blockchain, which stores information related to doctors, patients, and appointments. The system ensures that appointment details are added to the blockchain only after receiving consent from both doctor and patient, with RSA encryption providing secure communication between hospitals.

Data is encrypted on the sender side and decrypted on the receiver side before being stored in the blockchain. This setup guarantees privacy and security, but as the number of users and transactions increases, the scalability of the system becomes a crucial consideration.

The objective of this analysis is to assess how the system's performance is impacted as it scales, taking into account factors such as the growing size of the blockchain, increased transaction volume, and the computational overhead introduced by RSA encryption. We explore how the system handles increasing data load, focusing on areas like transaction throughput, network latency, and storage requirements. Additionally, we identify potential bottlenecks in the current setup and propose optimizations that could improve the scalability and efficiency of the system, ensuring it remains capable of supporting larger datasets and higher transaction volumes in a healthcare environment.

## Problem Statement

The healthcare industry is increasingly adopting blockchain technology to manage sensitive data in a secure and transparent way. However, consortium blockchains, which are designed specifically for healthcare, encounter significant challenges when it comes to scaling up as the number of participants and transaction volumes grow.

This project aims to explore the scalability of Ethereum-based consortium blockchains within the healthcare sector. It will assess how varying participant numbers affect key performance metrics such as transaction throughput (TPS), latency, resource utilization, and network bandwidth.

In addition to scalability, the project examines how integrating Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption impacts blockchain performance. RSA is used to ensure that sensitive healthcare data is securely transmitted, but the goal is to understand if this added security measure affects the overall efficiency of the blockchain.

By running simulations and conducting performance evaluations, the project seeks to uncover the optimal configurations that can enable healthcare blockchains to scale effectively, while maintaining high levels of security and performance. This research could help establish a more practical approach to building secure and efficient blockchain networks for the healthcare industry.
