contract("EmployeeDetails", (accounts) => {
  it("should set and get employee details", async () => {
    const employeeDetails = await EmployeeDetails.deployed();
    
    await employeeDetails.setEmployee(1, "Alice", 28, "Developer");
    const employee = await employeeDetails.getEmployee(1);
    
    assert.equal(employee[0], "Alice", "Name should be Alice");
    assert.equal(employee[1].toNumber(), 28, "Age should be 28");
