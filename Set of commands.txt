Notes for ourselves:
Change the address of the contract in the app.js to get the authorization error in the form of json RPC error.

Get a deployed instance:
const employeeDetails = await EmployeeDetails.deployed();

Set an employee Details:
await employeeDetails.setEmployee(1, "John Doe", 30, "Engineer");

Get the Details:
const employee = await employeeDetails.getEmployee(1);
console.log(employee);

Update the details:
await employeeDetails.updateEmployee(1, "John Doe", 31, "Senior Engineer");

Verifying the update:
const updatedEmployee = await employeeDetails.getEmployee(1);
console.log(updatedEmployee);


Testing the contract:
const EmployeeDetails = artifacts.require("EmployeeDetails");

contract("EmployeeDetails", (accounts) => {
  it("should set and get employee details", async () => {
    const employeeDetails = await EmployeeDetails.deployed();
    
    await employeeDetails.setEmployee(1, "Alice", 28, "Developer");
    const employee = await employeeDetails.getEmployee(1);
    
    assert.equal(employee[0], "Alice", "Name should be Alice");
    assert.equal(employee[1].toNumber(), 28, "Age should be 28");
    assert.equal(employee[2], "Developer", "Position should be Developer");
  });
});
